<p>Watermelon UI is a collection of premium Vue components built with HeadlessUI and styled using TailwindCSS. It's actively developed alongside my Vue projects, with new components regularly added to the GitHub repository. This very site showcases Watermelon UI in action, demonstrating its capabilities and evolving nature.</p>
